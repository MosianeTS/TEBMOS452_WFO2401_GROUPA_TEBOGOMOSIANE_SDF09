# Project Overview

This is a CSS frameworks project. The project entails the creation of a website footer using Tailwind CSS.
The goal of the project is to demonstrate understanding of Tailwind concepts such as utility classes and the use of CSS frameworks to
streamline web design.
The footer is designed to be responsive across different screen sizes.
I had no particular issues during this project and I learnt quite a lot with regards to the use of Tailwind in development projects.
I have also realised that the documentation that is provided by Tailwind is very useful to navigate the use of their utility classes.
